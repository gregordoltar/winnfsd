## 2.2.1 (September 7,2016)

**BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS:**
- Many memory leaks fixed (char * replaced with std::string) also memory was not freed
- Added nfs3fhsize_32 option. Some NFS clients do not like 64 bit handles
- When path is received it can be in form <path>/../<folder>. This introduced some problems. Path is now converted to canonical path,
